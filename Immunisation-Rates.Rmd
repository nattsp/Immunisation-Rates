## Immunisation Rates in Australia

There are net laws in Australia limiting financial assistance to families where children are not immunised. It is important we understand the rate of immunisation in this country.

The statistics in this presentation were gathered from the [Immunise Australia Program](http://www.immunise.health.gov.au/) webpage from the Australian Government - Department of Health.
